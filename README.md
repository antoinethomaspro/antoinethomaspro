### Hi, I'm Antoine ðŸ‘‹
I recently graduated from Sorbonne University master's degree in computer science. 
Even though I've taken a break from playing video games, I still stay abreast of the industry, fascinated by how the visuals continue to evolve and improve.


## ðŸ”­ Recent projects

- [renderer](https://github.com/antoinethomaspro/Simple-Renderer). Been adding new features to my terminal pomodoro timer including a macOS menu bar extension.
- RAYTRACING My master's thesis internship was about using hardware accelerated ray tracing to visualize volumetric data.  


## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

- [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com). ShaderToy has helped me get a little familiar with glsl, and I feel like I just stepped into a whole new world.

## âš¡ Fun facts

- E3 trailers (and sometimes how they got downgraded) raised my interest and this is how I got into computer graphics. 
- I like sports in general but lately I've been obssessed with tennis ðŸŽ¾
