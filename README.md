### Hi, I'm Antoine 👋



## 🔭 Recent projects

- RAYTRACING 
- [renderer](https://github.com/antoinethomaspro/Simple-Renderer). Been adding new features to my terminal pomodoro timer including a macOS menu bar extension.


## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com). ShaderToy has helped me get a little familiar with glsl, and I feel like I just stepped into a whole new world of computer graphics.

## ⚡ Fun facts

- E3 trailers and their downgrade raised my interest and this is how I got into computer graphics. 
- I like sports in general but lately I've been obssessed with tennis 🎾
